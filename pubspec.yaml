# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is

  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/

  #   - assets/images/coming_soon_wallpapers.jpg
  #   - assets/images/icon_with_shadow.png 
  #   - assets/images/Male0.png
  #   - assets/images/Male1.png
  #   - assets/images/Male.png
  #   - assets/images/Female0.png
  #   - assets/images/Female1.png
  #   - assets/images/Female.png
  #   - assets/images/bg1.jpg
  #   - assets/images/bg2.jpg
  #   - assets/images/bg3.jpg
  #   - assets/images/bg6.jpg
  #   - assets/images/icons8-google.svg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: gilroy_bold
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Gilroy-Bold.ttf
    - family: gilroy_bolditalic
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Gilroy-BoldItalic.ttf
    - family: gilroy_regular
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Gilroy-Regular.ttf
    - family: gilroy_regularitalic
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Gilroy-RegularItalic.ttf
    - family: teko-med
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Teko-Medium.ttf
    - family: teko-reg
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Teko-Regular.ttf
